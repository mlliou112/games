# 22

### Setup

Start with 6 cards to each player.
Starting left of the dealer, players can exchange any number of cards.

# Gameplay
* Basic rule, you have to beat the previous card. Tying the card counts as beating it. If you can't or don't want to beat it, you MUST play your lowest card.
* You can start with a double, but others don't have to beat it with a double, but they do have to beat both, or play both of their lowest.
* Whoever has the HIGHEST card as their last card, loses and keeps that card. Those cards contribute toward their point total. Both lose if there are ties for the highest card. If you get more than 22 points, you lose and are out of the game.
* Any face cards just count as a 10.
* The next round is played with the same number of cards as the number of points that the loser got that round. The loser will also have to shuffle the cards and deal.
